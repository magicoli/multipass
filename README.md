Group orders from different sources (WooCommerce, OTA, booking engines...) to get the global picture of a set of services.

## Description

Bring orders from several sources together and see them as a single provision of services.

Particularly useful in lodging facilities, and if your business offers other kinds of services (meals, vehicule rentals, merchandising, local products...) that are not or poorly handled by the main booking engine.

This should also fit well for other kind of services, needing a more fluid approach than WooCommerce.

### Use cases

- An order is created and paid upon reservation, but **additional services are usually added later** (e.g. once the service begins).
- Your booking engine **can not handle the other services you provide**.
- When customer book several rooms, so your booking engine create **separated orders**, one for each room.
- You use an external booking engine, but you prefer to **collect payments on your website** (e.g. with WooCommerce)
- You need to handle **partial payments**.
- You need to **validate booking** when deposit threshold is reached.

## Features

- Centralized view of prestations (sets of services, ordered as parts of a common project).
- Prestations admin list, showing service dates and payment status.
- Prestation or service level deposit percentage or fixed amount.
- Prestation or service level discount percentage or fixed amount.
- Summarized payment status, centralizing amounts paid locally or via external providers.
